# Algorithms Animator

This is a Python application that implements and animates interactively those algorithms that are normally covered in an undergraduate course on the topic. It includes:

- Insertion Sort
- Quicksort
- Mergesort
- AVL Tree Search/Insert/Rebalance
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Topological Sort
- Prim
- Kruskal
- Dijkstra
- LCS
- Huffman-Fano

It is extensible. All the API are exposed.

This program was originally designed in 2003 for teaching "Design and Analysis of Algorithms" at DePaul University. All the algorithms in the source code (src/csc321algorithms.py) are equivalent line-by-line to the pseudo-code in the MIT CLRS "Introduction to Algorithms" book.

Re-released under BSD license (original was GPL).

On windows start it with:

    bin/AlgorithmsAnimator.exe

On other systems with Python 2.5 or later (2.x):
 
    cd src
    python AlgorithmsAnimator.py
